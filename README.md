Forum
=====

Basic forum. My goal here is to learn how the components of a web project come together. Intentionally a little messy with patchwork features as I learn and integrate new things.

To Do:

* (done) --------------- Get basic forum structure up
* (done) --------------- Get all forms working properly
* (done) --------------- Fix up Topic data structure
* (done) --------------- Add working user register/login system
* (done) --------------- Implement Categories (do this ASAP before things get too complicated)
* (done) --------------- Show topic/post statistics (use @Transient, didn't know about this magical annotation b4)

* (in progress) ------- Add category-specific custom data post options
* (in progress) ------- Admin functionality (removal of posts, editing, etc)
* (in progress) ------- Add rating system per post (db system required to track who voted for what)

* ------------------------- Sort posts chronologically, add option for sorting by rating
* (delay) --------------- Use ajax to load tables instead of refreshing whole page
