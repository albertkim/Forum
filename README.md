Forum
=====

Basic forum. My goal here is to learn how the components of a web project come together. Intentionally a little messy with patchwork features as I learn and integrate new things.

To Do:

* (x) Get basic forum structure up
* (x) Get all forms working properly
* (x) Fix up Topic data structure
* (x) Add working user register/login system
*     Show topic/post statistics
*     Admin functionality (removal of posts, editing, etc)
*     Use ajax to load tables instead of refreshing whole page
*     Fix up Category data strucutre
*     Implement Categories
*     Add rating system per post, store in db
*     Sort posts chronologically, add option for sorting by rating
