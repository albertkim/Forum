Forum
=====

Basic forum. My goal here is to learn how the components of a web project come together. Intentionally a little messy with patchwork features as I learn and integrate new things.

To Do:

* (done) ------------- Get basic forum structure up
* (done) ------------- Get all forms working properly
* (done) ------------- Fix up Topic data structure
* (done) ------------- Add working user register/login system
* (done) ------------- Implement Categories (do this ASAP before things get too complicated)
* (in progress) ------ Add category-specific custom data post options
* -------------------- Show topic/post statistics
* (in progress) ------ Admin functionality (removal of posts, editing, etc)
* (delay) ------------ Use ajax to load tables instead of refreshing whole page
* -------------------- Add rating system per post, store in db
* -------------------- Sort posts chronologically, add option for sorting by rating
